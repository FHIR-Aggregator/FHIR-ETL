# 1000 Genomes
A previous version of this application required the user to obtain data from the 1K Genomes site manually. I have since updated the code so that the program obtains the data automatically using the Selenium library to navigate a Firefox browser. The Selenium bot does the following: It navigates to [InternationalGenome.org](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/sample), then filters by data collection on the following points "1000 Genomes 30x on GRCh38", "1000 Genomes on GRCh38", "1000 Genomes phase 1 release", "1000 Genomes phase 3 release" from the dropdown, and clicks 'download the list'. It then moves the output tsv titled **igsr_samples.tsv** to the execution directory of the code, then turns that tsv into a dataframe and runs a function that formats everthing into a FHIR-friendly JSON. The result is FHIRized json output file.

The total number of columns is a tad sparse in 1K Genomes' metadata which means the code is rather rudimentary as well. The fields I'm looking for in the metadata of various projects (including this one) are being driven by a particular implementation of the FHIR standard found here: [NCPI FHIR IG v2](https://nih-ncpi.github.io/ncpi-fhir-ig-2/artifacts.html#structures-resource-profiles). Despite the labelling of the metadata as igsr_samples.tsv, the columns within more closely resemble the fields of [NCPI Participant](https://nih-ncpi.github.io/ncpi-fhir-ig-2/StructureDefinition-ncpi-participant.html#profile) from the above Implementation Guide.
