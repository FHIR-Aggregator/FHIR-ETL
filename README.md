# FHIR-ETL
This repository's goal is to extract data from sources found by the NCPI FHIR Aggregator Team, convert the data therein to the FHIR standard, and make this FHIRized data available to the wider public.

I have FHIRizations for two projects currently, **1000 Genomes** and **GTeX**. More information about each can be found in their folders.
