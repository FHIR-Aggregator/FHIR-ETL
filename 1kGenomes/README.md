# 1000 Genomes
This code is a simple ETL that takes as its initial input **20130606_sample_info.txt** found in the [1KG FTP Server](https://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/technical/working/20130606_sample_info/). The data within 20130606_sample_info is some paltry demographic data for Patients and a small amount of Specimen items as well (most columns with Specimen-related details are a bit too hard-nosed medical data). We create a Patient, Specimen, ResearchSubject, and ResearchStudy resource from the available data in the sample_info.txt.
