# FHIR-ETL
This repository's goal is to extract from the broader set of sources that CDA currently pulls its initial data from (**G**enomic **D**ata **C**ommons, **P**roteomic **D**ata **C**ommons, **I**maging **D**ata **C**ommons, **C**ancer **D**ata **C**ommons) and myriad other sources found by our NCPI Aggregator Team, make them all _work nice_ together (via harmonization to borrow the CDA term), convert their harmonized data to a wider FHIR configuration, and make this FHIRized data available to the wider public.
