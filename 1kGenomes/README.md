# 1000 Genomes
You can find data for 1K Genomes at the following website: [InternationalGenome.org](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/). Click filter by data collection, then select "1000 Genomes 30x on GRCh38", "1000 Genomes on GRCh38", "1000 Genomes phase 1 release", "1000 Genomes phase 3 release" from the dropdown, finally click 'downlaod the list' and you'll get a csv titled **igsr_samples.tsv**. Place that file in the same directory as the code in this repository and run to receive a FHIRized json output file.

The total number of columns is a tad sparse in 1K Genomes' metadata which means the code is rather rudimentary as well. The fields I'm looking for in the metadata of various projects (including this one) are being driven by a particular implementation of the FHIR standard found here: [NCPI FHIR IG v2](https://nih-ncpi.github.io/ncpi-fhir-ig-2/artifacts.html#structures-resource-profiles). Despite the labelling of the metadata as igsr_samples.tsv, the columns within more closely resemble the fields of [NCPI Participant](https://nih-ncpi.github.io/ncpi-fhir-ig-2/StructureDefinition-ncpi-participant.html#profile) from the above Implementation Guide.
