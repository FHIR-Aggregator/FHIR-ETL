# GTEx
Compared to 1K Genomes, GTEx [offers](https://gtexportal.org/api/v2/redoc#tag/Datasets-Endpoints/operation/get_subject_api_v2_dataset_subject_get) [metadata](https://gtexportal.org/api/v2/redoc#tag/Datasets-Endpoints/operation/get_sample_api_v2_dataset_sample_get) that closely aligns to not just [one](https://nih-ncpi.github.io/ncpi-fhir-ig-2/StructureDefinition-ncpi-participant.html#profile) but [two](https://nih-ncpi.github.io/ncpi-fhir-ig-2/StructureDefinition-ncpi-sample.html#profile) FHIR Resource profiles. While you could download metadata directly from the [website](https://gtexportal.org/home/downloads/adult-gtex/metadata), GTEx also offers an API that's always up-to-date meaning there's no need for any manual downloads. However, this does mean that the code has to download the data from the API before FHIRizing it, and this takes some time considering that one of the metadata profiles we care about (Sample) has 43k rows. Like 1KG, we generate four total resources from these API calls, those being Patient, Specimen, ResearchSubject, and ResearchStudy. 

ToDo: Possibly add a DocumentReference resource here because there exists a [file related](https://gtexportal.org/api/v2/redoc#tag/Datasets-Endpoints/operation/get_file_list_api_v2_dataset_fileList_get) dataset endpoint in the GTEx API as well.
